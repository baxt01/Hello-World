# Hello-World
MnvB Test Repo.
I have been learning several programming languages from PHP and Ruby as well as brushing up on my HTML and CSS to try to keep up to date with the recent language releases and have since put together a small and very basic DB driven CMS which i am still working on to make some more advanced versions of.
I will also be looking to add some user level login system and then i will go on to try adding some role based user system.
